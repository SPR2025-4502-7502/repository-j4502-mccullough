		<p>In designing my first website, the choices I made regarding what I wanted to include in the layout and overall design of my website were purposeful. I wanted my first website to be organized, simple, and easy to navigate. I made sure this was executed by refraining from lengthy text, keeping a consistent fromat to each page, and using different font styles for different headers and paragraphs. I wanted the overall design to go well with each page topic. To do this, I chose different color backgrounds that fit the tone and topic of each page. Overall, I wanted my first website to tell a story about some of my favorite things. This meant showing off my dog, talking about my favorite outdoor spots in my home state, revealing my favorite restaurants, and discussing some of my favorite biopics. Overall, I hope that this website tells a story about who I am, all while being easy to navigate. </p>
